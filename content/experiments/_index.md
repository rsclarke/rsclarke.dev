# Experiments

After reading Tiny Experiments by Anne-Laure Le Cunff and embracing the experimental mindset, I wanted to a place to document my own experiments and learnings.  Posts within each of the experiments are most likely rough notes on a topic, but hopefully there is some value to you in how I approached the subject or even solve a problem you encountered too.
