# Sample Experiment - Introduction

This is the first day of a multi-day experiment series. In this series, we'll explore a specific topic through multiple connected posts.

## What is this experiment about?

This sample experiment demonstrates how related posts are automatically connected through Hugo's section-based organization. All posts in this directory are part of the same experiment series.

## Why experiments?

Unlike one-off articles, experiments allow for exploration of a topic through multiple interconnected posts. This format is ideal for:

- Step-by-step tutorials
- Ongoing research
- Progressive learning journeys
- Projects that evolve over time

## Coming up next

In the next part of this series, we'll continue exploring this topic by diving deeper into specific aspects and building upon what we've covered here. The navigation to other posts in this experiment series is automatically generated.
